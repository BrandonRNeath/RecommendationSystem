# Recommendation System 

The recommendation system was developed to work along side the Fitness Android application that was developed for my Final year project. The developed Fitness application consisted of a diary feature where users could enter their food and drink they have had throughout their day as well as the exercises they completed. This recommendation system carries out user based recommendations using Pearson Correlation Similarity and provides daily recommendations to the users of the application for both a nutrition recommendation and a exercise recommendation. The system determines its recommendations off users that are similiar to one another.

## Recommendation System Instructions
